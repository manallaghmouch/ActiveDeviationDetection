# ActiveDeviationDetection
 This repository includes the data and code for detecting a small subset of relevant deviations, called notable items, within a large set of deviating transactions in a simulated audit environment. Active Learning with Uncertainty Sampling is applied to enhance the detection process and actively involve auditors during learning.
